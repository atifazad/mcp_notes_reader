The scientific method is the cornerstone of modern science: a systematic approach to acquiring knowledge through observation, experimentation, and reasoning.

In fields such as physics, biology, and chemistry, this method has yielded profound discoveries—from Newton’s laws of motion to the structure of DNA and the periodic table of elements.

Science is not static; it evolves as new evidence emerges and old theories are revised or replaced. For example, Einstein’s theory of relativity reshaped our understanding of space and time, while quantum mechanics revealed the probabilistic nature of particles at microscopic scales.

At its best, science is a self-correcting process, driven by curiosity and skepticism, expanding the frontiers of what we know about the universe and ourselves.

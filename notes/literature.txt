Literature reflects the human condition in its countless forms: joy, sorrow, hope, despair, love, and loss. Across cultures and ages, writers have sought to capture the essence of human experience through narrative, poetry, drama, and essays.

From the epics of Homer to the modernist experiments of Virginia Woolf, literature offers both a window into different times and places and a mirror in which we recognize ourselves.

Themes of identity, conflict, belonging, and morality pervade literary works, creating opportunities for readers to grapple with complex questions and emotions.

In reading literature, we not only entertain ourselves but also cultivate empathy and understanding for lives different from our own.
